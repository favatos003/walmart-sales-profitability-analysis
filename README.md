# Walmart Sales & Profitability Analysis

## Business Problem
Walmart generates high sales volumes across multiple product categories and customer segments, but high revenue does not always translate into high profitability. This project analyzes sales data to identify profit drivers and revenue inefficiencies.

## Objective
To evaluate sales and profit performance across time, product categories, sub-categories, and customer segments to support data-driven decisions in inventory planning, pricing strategy, and customer prioritization.

## Key Insights
- Sales and profit exhibit strong seasonal patterns
- High sales categories are not always the most profitable
- Certain customer segments generate inefficient revenue
- Profit margin and sales contribution KPIs reveal true performance drivers

## Business Impact
The analysis highlights opportunities to improve profitability by focusing on high-margin products, optimizing inventory by season, and prioritizing efficient customer segments—without increasing overall sales volume.
